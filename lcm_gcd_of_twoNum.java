// Given two integers a and b, write a function lcmAndGcd() to compute their LCM and GCD. The function inputs two integers a and b and returns a list containing their LCM and GCD.

// Examples:

// Input: a = 5 , b = 10
// Output: [10, 5]
// Explanation: LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while their GCD is 5.
// Input: a = 14 , b = 8
// Output: [56, 2]
// Explanation: LCM of 14 and 8 is 56, while their GCD is 2.
