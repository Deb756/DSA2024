// Given a number num, our task is to find the closest Palindrome number whose absolute difference with the given number is minimal. If 2 Palindrome numbers have the same absolute difference as the given number, take the smaller one.

// Example 1:

// Input: num = 9
// Output: 9
// Explanation: 9 itself is a palindrome
// number.
// Example 2:

// Input: num = 489
// Output: 484
// Explanation: closest palindrome numbers from
// 489 are 484 and 494. Absolute difference between
// 489 and 494 is equal to the absolute difference
// between 484 and 489 but 484 is smaller than 494.
